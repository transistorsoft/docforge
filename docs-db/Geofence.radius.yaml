description: |-
  Radius of the circular geofence.

  ⚠️ The minimum reliable `radius` is __`200`__ meters.  Anything less will likely not cause a geofence to trigger.
  This is documented by Apple [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/LocationAwarenessPG/RegionMonitoring/RegionMonitoring.html):
  > *"The specific threshold distances are determined by the hardware and the location technologies that are currently available. For example, if WiFi is disabled, region monitoring
  is significantly less accurate. However, for testing purposes, __you can assume that the minimum distance is approximately 200 meters__*".
