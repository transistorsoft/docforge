description: |-
  Signal to the plugin that your app is launched and ready, proving the default {@link Config}.

  The supplied {@link Config} will be applied **only at first install** of your app — for every launch thereafter,
  the plugin will automatically load its last-known configuration from persistent storage.
  The plugin always remembers the configuration you apply to it.

  @example example-1

  __⚠️ Warning:__
  - You must call __`.ready(confg)`__ **once** and **only** once, each time your app is launched.
  - Do not hide the call to `.ready(config)` within a view which is loaded only by clicking a UI action.  This is particularly important
  for iOS in the case where the OS relaunches your app in the background when the device is detected to be moving.  If you don't ensure that `.ready(config)` is called in this case, tracking will not resume.

  __The {@link reset} method.__

  If you wish, you can use the {@link reset} method to reset all {@link Config} options to documented default-values (with optional overrides):

  __{@link Config.reset}: false__

  Configuring the plugin with __`reset: false`__ should generally be avoided unless you know *exactly* what it does.  People often find this from the *Demo* app.  If you do configure `reset: false`, you'll find that your `Config` provided to `.ready` is consumed **only at first launch after install**.  Thereafter, the plugin will ignore any changes you've provided there.  The only way to change the config then is to use {@link setConfig}.

  You will especially not want to use `reset: false` during development, while you're fine-tuning your `Config` options.

  The reason the *Demo* app uses `reset: false` is because it hosts an advanced "*Settings*" screen to tune the `Config` at runtime and we don't want those runtime changes to be overwritten by `.ready(config)` each time the app launches.

  ⚠️ If you *don't* undestand what __`reset: false`__ does, **NO NOT USE IT**.  If you blindly copy/pasted it from the *Demo* app, **REMOVE IT** from your `Config`.
