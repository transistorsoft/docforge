signature: 'onProviderChange(cb: (event: ProviderChangeEvent) => void): Subscription;'
description: |-
  Subscribe to changes in device's location-services configuration / authorization.

  Your `callback` fill be executed whenever a change in the state of the device's **Location Services** has been detected.  eg: "GPS ON", "WiFi only".

  @example example-1

  __ℹ️ See also:__
  - You can explicitly request the current state of location-services using {@link getProviderState}.

  __⚠️ Note:__
  - The plugin always force-fires an {@link onProviderChange} event whenever the app is launched (right after the {@link ready} method is executed), regardless of current state, so you can learn the the current state of location-services with each boot of your application.
