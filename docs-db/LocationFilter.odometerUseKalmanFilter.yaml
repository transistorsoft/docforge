signature: 'odometerUseKalmanFilter?: boolean;'
description: |-
  Applies a Kalman filter **only to odometer calculations**, independent of
  {@link LocationFilter.useKalman}.

  When `true`, the odometer’s internal distance-accumulation logic applies a
  Kalman filter to smooth incoming samples, reducing jitter and noise **without**
  modifying the recorded track points.

  This is useful when you want smoother odometer readings while preserving
  the raw location stream for mapping, analysis, or debugging.

  If both {@link LocationFilter.useKalman} and
  {@link LocationFilter.odometerUseKalmanFilter} are `true`, the SDK maintains
  **independent Kalman filter instances** for tracking and odometer calculations.

  Default: `true`.
