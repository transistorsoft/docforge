signature: 'headers?: Record<string, string>;'
description: |-
  Optional HTTP headers applied to every outbound upload request.

  These headers are merged with the SDK’s automatically applied headers
  (such as `"content-type": "application/json"`). When using authorization,
  the SDK also injects an `Authorization` header as needed.

  @example example-1

  Observing incoming requests at your server:

  ```text
  POST /locations
  {
    "host": "tracker.transistorsoft.com",
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "content-length": "456",
    ...
    "authorization": "Bearer <a secret key>",
    "X-FOO": "BAR"
  }
  ```

  **Note:**
  The SDK automatically applies several required headers, including:
  - `"content-type": "application/json"`
  - authorization headers when using {@link AuthorizationConfig}

  __See also:__ the **HTTP Guide** under {@link HttpConfig}.
