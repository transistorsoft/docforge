description: |-
  Accumulated **odometer drift**, in meters.

  __ℹ️ Why does this exist?__
  - The SDK maintains a continuously increasing {@link odometer} value by integrating distance between recorded locations.
  - When GNSS accuracy is degraded (tunnels, downtown canyons, indoor / underground environments), distance calculations can accumulate **drift**.
  - The `odometer_error` value tells you *how much uncertainty* has accumulated in the current odometer estimate.

  __How to use it:__
  - Treat this as a “confidence interval” for {@link odometer}.
    For example, if `odometer = 12000` and `odometer_error = 40`, the *true* travelled distance is likely within **±40 meters** of the reported value.
  - Resetting or setting a new {@link odometer} value automatically resets `odometer_error` to `0`.
  - Values typically remain low (e.g., < 10m) during good GPS conditions, but can grow during:
    - long tunnels
    - heavy multipath environments
    - extended indoor tracking

  __Best practice:__
  - Display `odometer` normally to end-users.
  - Use `odometer_error` internally for data-quality scoring, filtering, or highlighting low-accuracy segments.

    code:
      ts: |-
        BackgroundGeolocation.onLocation(location => {
          console.log("Odometer:", location.odometer);
          console.log("Odometer drift:", location.odometer_error);

          if (location.odometer_error > 50) {
            console.warn("High odometer drift — signal quality degraded");
          }
        });
