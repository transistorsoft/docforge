description: |-
  Balanced (default) — applies moderate filtering to reject noisy samples.

  Dynamically adjusts acceptance thresholds for incoming samples, but **never**
  alters the raw latitude/longitude coordinates.

  When using {@link LocationFilterPolicy.Adjust} (the default), the SDK computes
  motion metrics such as:

  - distance deltas
  - implied speed
  - accuracy variance
  - heading stability

  It then applies adaptive gating rules to decide whether each sample should be:

  - accepted
  - ignored
  - rejected as noise

  **Coordinates are never modified.** This policy adjusts *which* samples are
  included, not *how* they are positioned.

  If {@link LocationFilter.useKalman} is enabled, additional smoothing may occur,
  but the physical coordinates of each accepted sample remain untouched.
