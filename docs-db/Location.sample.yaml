description: |-
  `true` if the plugin is currently waiting for the best possible location to arrive.  Samples are recorded when the plugin is transitioning between motion-states (*moving* vs *stationary*) or {@link BackgroundGeolocation.getCurrentPosition}.
  If you're manually posting location to your server, you should not persist these "samples".
