signature: 'sync(): Promise<Array<Object>>;'
description: |-
  Manually execute upload to configured {@link HttpConfig.url} of all {@link Location} records currently stored in the SDK's SQLite database.

  If the plugin is configured for HTTP with an {@link HttpConfig.url} and {@link HttpConfig.autoSync} `false`, the {@link sync} method will initiate POSTing the locations
  currently stored in the native SQLite database to your configured {@link HttpConfig.url}.  When your HTTP server returns a response of `200 OK`, that record(s)
  in the database will be DELETED.

  If you configured {@link HttpConfig.batchSync} `true`, all the locations will be sent to your server in a single HTTP POST request, otherwise the plugin will
  execute an HTTP post for **each** {@link Location} in the database (REST-style).  Your callback will be executed and provided with a `List` of all the
  locations from the SQLite database.  If you configured the plugin for HTTP (by configuring a {@link HttpConfig.url}), your callback will be executed after all
  the HTTP request(s) have completed.  If the plugin failed to sync to your server (possibly because of no network connection), the failure callback will
  be called with an error message.  If you are **not** using the HTTP features, {@link sync} will delete all records from its SQLite database.
