  The minimum distance (measured in meters) a device must move horizontally before an update event is generated.

  However, by default, **`distanceFilter`** is elastically auto-calculated by the plugin:  When speed increases, **`distanceFilter`** increases;  when speed decreases, so too does **`distanceFilter`**.


  ### ℹ️ Note:
  - To disable this behavior, configure {@link disableElasticity} __`true`__.
  - To control the scale of the automatic `distanceFilter` calculation, see {{@link elasticityMultiplier}

  `distanceFilter` is auto-scaled by rounding speed to the nearest `5 m/s` and adding `distanceFilter` meters for each `5 m/s` increment.

  For example, at biking speed of 7.7 m/s with a configured `distanceFilter: 30`:
  @example example-1

  At highway speed of `27 m/s` with a configured `distanceFilter: 50`:
  @example example-2

  Note the following real example of "elasticity" on highway 101 towards San Francisco as the driver slows down while running into
  slower traffic &mdash; locations become compressed as `distanceFilter` decreases.

  track is walking speed.

examples:
  example-1:
    title: Example 1
    code:
      ts: |2-
          rounded_speed = round(7.7, 5)
          => 10
          multiplier = rounded_speed / 5
          => 10 / 5 = 2
          adjusted_distance_filter = multiplier * distanceFilter
          => 2 * 30 = 60 meters
  example-2:
    title: Example 2
    code:
      ts: |2-
          rounded_speed = round(27, 5)
          => 30
          multiplier = rounded_speed / 5
          => 30 / 5 = 6
          adjusted_distance_filter = multiplier * distanceFilter * elasticityMultipiler
          => 6 * 50 = 300 meters
