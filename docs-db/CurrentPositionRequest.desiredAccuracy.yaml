signature: 'desiredAccuracy?: number;'
description: |-
  Sets the desired accuracy of location you're attempting to fetch. When a location having `accuracy <= desiredAccuracy` is retrieved, the plugin will stop sampling and immediately return that location. Defaults to your configured {@link GeoConfig.stationaryRadius}.

  __Note__:  This `desiredAccuracy` does not have the same meaning as {@link GeoConfig.desiredAccuracy}.  The `desiredAccuracy` in this context is a threshold which the plugin uses to determine when to stop sampling locations.  For example, if you set `desiredAccuracy: 10`, the plugin will continue to fetch locations until it retrieves one with an accuracy of `10` meters or better.  `getCurrentPosition` __always__ requests locations from the native location API using the highest possible accuracy ({@link DesiredAccuracy.High}).
