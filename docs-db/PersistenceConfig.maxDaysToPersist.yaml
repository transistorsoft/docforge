signature: 'maxDaysToPersist?: number;'
description: |-
  Maximum number of days to retain a persisted geolocation record
  in the plugin’s on-device SQLite database.

  When your server fails to return **HTTP 200 OK**, the SDK will continue
  retrying uploads according to your {@link HttpConfig} settings. If a record
  remains unuploaded for longer than **maxDaysToPersist**, it will be
  permanently discarded to prevent unbounded database growth.
