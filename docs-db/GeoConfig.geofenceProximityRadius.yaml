signature: 'geofenceProximityRadius?: number;'
description: |-
  Defines the radius (in meters) around the device used to query for geofences
  that should be actively monitored.

  The default — and **minimum** — value is **1000 meters**.

  Mobile platforms allow only a limited number of concurrently monitored geofences
  (**iOS: 20**, **Android: ~100**).

  The SDK removes this limitation by allowing you to register **any number of geofences**
  (thousands even). It stores them in its internal database and performs efficient
  spatial queries to determine which subset of geofences should be activated based on
  the device’s current position.

  As the device moves, this radius determines when the monitored geofence set changes,
  firing {@link BackgroundGeolocation.onGeofencesChange}.
