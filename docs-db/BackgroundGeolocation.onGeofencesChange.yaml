signature: 'onGeofencesChange(cb: (event: GeofencesChangeEvent) => void): Subscription;'
description: |-
  Subscribe to changes in actively monitored geofences.

  Fired when the list of monitored-geofences changed.  The BackgroundGeolocation SDK contains powerful geofencing features that allow you to monitor
  any number of circular geofences you wish (thousands even), in spite of limits imposed by the native platform APIs (**20 for iOS; 100 for Android**).

  The plugin achieves this by storing your geofences in its database, using a [geospatial query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_query) to determine
  those geofences in proximity (@see {@link GeoConfig.geofenceProximityRadius}), activating only those geofences closest to the device's current location
  (according to limit imposed by the corresponding platform).

  When the device is determined to be moving, the plugin periodically queries for geofences in proximity (eg. every minute) using the latest recorded
  location.  This geospatial query is **very fast**, even with tens-of-thousands geofences in the database.

  It's when this list of monitored geofences *changes*, that the plugin will fire the `onGeofencesChange` event.
