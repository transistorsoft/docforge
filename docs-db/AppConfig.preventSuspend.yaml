signature: 'preventSuspend?: boolean;'
description: |-
  **iOS only** — Prevent iOS from suspending your application after location-services
  have been turned off while running in the background.

  Defaults to **`false`**.

  Set **`true`** to keep your application alive in the background even after iOS
  disables location-services. This is required when using a
  {@link AppConfig.heartbeatInterval | heartbeat interval}.

  **⚠️ Warning**

  - `preventSuspend: true` should be used **only for very specific use-cases**.
    It has a **large and noticeable impact on battery consumption**.
  - You should enable `preventSuspend` only for controlled periods of time.
    It is **not suitable** for continuous 24/7 operation.
  - When the device is **unplugged** with the screen **off**, iOS still throttles
    {@link BackgroundGeolocation.onHeartbeat} about **2 minutes** after entering the
    background.

    Heartbeats resume immediately if:
    - the screen turns on, or
    - even the slightest device-motion is detected.
