  __`[iOS 14+]`__ iOS 14 has introduced a new __`[Precise: On]`__ switch on the location authorization dialog allowing users to disable high-accuracy location.

  The method [`requestTemporaryFullAccuracy` (Apple docs)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/3600217-requesttemporaryfullaccuracyauth?language=objc) will allow you to present a dialog to the user requesting temporary *full accuracy* for the lifetime of this application run (until terminate).

  __Configuration &mdash; `Info.plist`__

  In order to use this method, you must configure your __`Info.plist`__ with the `Dictionary` key:
  __`Privacy - Location Temporary Usage Description Dictionary`__

  ![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/52f5lnjc4d9g8w7/ios-14-Privacy-Location-Temporary-Usage-Description-Dictionary.png?dl=1)

  The keys of this `Dictionary` (eg: `Delivery`) are supplied as the first argument to the method.  The `value` will be printed on the dialog shown to the user, explaing the purpose of your request for full accuracy.

  If the dialog fails to be presented, an error will be thrown:
  - The Info.plist file doesn’t have an entry for the given purposeKey value.
  - The app is already authorized for full accuracy.
  - The app is in the background.

  __Note:__ Android and older versions of iOS `< 14` will return {@link AccuracyAuthorization.Full}.
