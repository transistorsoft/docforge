signature: 'getCurrentPosition(options?: CurrentPositionRequest): Promise<Location>;'
description: |-
  Retrieves the current {@link Location}.

  This method instructs the native code to fetch exactly one location using maximum power & accuracy.  The native code will persist the fetched location to
  its SQLite database just as any other location in addition to POSTing to your configured {@link HttpConfig.url}.
  If an error occurs while fetching the location, `catch` will be provided with an {@link LocationError}.


  ### Options

  See {@link CurrentPositionRequest}.

  ### Error Codes

  See {@link LocationError}.

  @example example-1
  __⚠️ Note:__
  - While `getCurrentPosition` will receive only **one** {@link Location}, the plugin *does* request **multiple** location samples which will all be provided
  to the {@link onLocation} event-listener.  You can detect these samples via {@link Location.sample} `== true`.

        let location = await BackgroundGeolocation.getCurrentPosition({
          timeout: 30,          // 30 second timeout to fetch location
          maximumAge: 5000,     // Accept the last-known-location if not older than 5000 ms.
          desiredAccuracy: 10,  // Try to fetch a location with an accuracy of `10` meters.
          samples: 3,           // How many location samples to attempt.
          extras: {             // Custom meta-data.
