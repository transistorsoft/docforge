signature: 'startOnBoot?: boolean;'
description: |-
  Controls whether to resume location-tracking after the device is **rebooted**.

  Defaults to **`false`**.

  Set {@link AppConfig.startOnBoot} to **`true`** to automatically re-engage background tracking
  after a device restart.

  __iOS__

  iOS cannot **immediately** begin tracking after a device reboot.  Similar to {@link AppConfig.stopOnTerminate}: `false`, iOS will not relaunch your app until:
  - The device moves beyond the **stationary geofence** created around the last known location, or
  - A system **Background Fetch** event fires (typically every ~15 minutes), which can also restart your app.

  __Android__

  When {@link AppConfig.startOnBoot} is `true`, Android will automatically relaunch the SDK’s
  background service after reboot (and initial device unlock).

  If {@link AppConfig.enableHeadless} is also `true`, tracking will resume even if the JS/UI layer
  has not yet started.
