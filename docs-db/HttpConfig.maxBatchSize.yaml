signature: 'maxBatchSize?: number;'
description: |-
  Controls the number of records attached to **each** batched HTTP request.

  Defaults to **`-1`** (no maximum).

  When using {@link batchSync} with {@link url} configured,
  this option limits how many queued location records may be included in a single
  HTTP request.

  If the number of queued records exceeds `maxBatchSize`, the SDK will generate
  **multiple HTTP requests** until the queue is fully drained.

  This prevents extremely large request bodies when the device has been offline
  for long periods (where megabytes of location data may accumulate).
