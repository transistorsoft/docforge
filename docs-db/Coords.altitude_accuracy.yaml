  Altitude accuracy in meters.

  If this location does not have `altitude_accuracy`, then `-1` is returned.

  __iOS:__

  When this property contains 0 or a positive number, the value in the altitude property is plus or minus the specified number of meters. When this property contains a negative number, the value in the altitude property is invalid.

  Determining the [altitudeAccuracy] requires a device with GPS capabilities. Thus, on some devices, this property always contains a negative value.

  __Android:__

  Android defines vertical accuracy at 68% confidence. Specifically, as 1-side of the 2-sided range above and below the estimated altitude reported by [altitude], within which there is a 68% probability of finding the true altitude.

  In the case where the underlying distribution is assumed Gaussian normal, this would be considered 1 standard deviation.

  For example, if [altitude] returns `150`, and [verticalAccuracy] returns `20` then there is a 68% probability of the true altitude being between `130` and `170` meters.
