signature: 'maxImpliedSpeed?: number;'
description: |-
  Maximum implied speed (in meters/second) permitted before a location
  sample is rejected.

  If a raw sample implies a speed **greater than this threshold**, it is
  considered an unrealistic outlier and will be discarded by the filter.

  **Default:** `60` m/s (≈ 216 km/h).
