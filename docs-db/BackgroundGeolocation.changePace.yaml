source_file: background-geolocation-types/src/core/api/BackgroundGeolocation.ts
signature: 'changePace(isMoving: boolean): Promise<State>;'
description: |-
  Manually toggles the SDK's **motion state** between **stationary** and **moving**.

  When provided a value of  **`true`**, the plugin will engage location-services and begin aggressively tracking the device's location *immediately*,
  bypassing stationary monitoring.

  If you were making a "Jogging" application, this would be your **`[Start Workout]`** button to immediately begin location-tracking.  Send **`false`**
  to turn **off** location-services and return the plugin to the **stationary** state.
