description: |-
  The minimum distance the device must move beyond the stationary location for aggressive background-tracking to engage.

  ⚠️ Note: The device will not detect the exact moment it moves out of the stationary-radius.  In normal conditions, it will typically
  take **~200 meters** of movement before the plugin begins tracking.

  Configuring **`stationaryRadius: 0`** has **NO EFFECT**.  In fact the plugin enforces a minimum **`stationaryRadius`** of `25` and
  in-practice, the native API won't respond for at least 200 meters.

  The following image shows the typical distance iOS requires to detect exit of the **`stationaryRadius`**:
  - *Green polylines*: represent a transition from **stationary** state to **moving** (__~200 meters__).
  - *Red circles*: locations where the plugin entered the **stationary** state.
