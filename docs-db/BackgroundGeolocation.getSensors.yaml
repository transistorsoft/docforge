signature: 'getSensors(): Promise<Sensors>;'
description: |-
  Returns the presence of device sensors *accelerometer*, *gyroscope*, *magnetometer*

  These core {@link Sensors} are used by the motion activity-recognition system -- when any of these sensors are missing from a device (particularly on cheap
  Android devices), the performance of the motion activity-recognition system will be **severely** degraded and highly inaccurate.
