description: |-
  Defines the filtering policy applied to incoming raw GPS samples before they
  are accepted, averaged, or rejected by the {@link LocationFilter}.

  The filtering policy determines how aggressively the plugin removes noisy,
  inaccurate, or redundant location updates. It represents the *first stage*
  in the SDK’s data-quality pipeline — before Kalman smoothing, burst averaging,
  or other denoising steps are applied.

  Choosing the correct policy depends on your app’s tolerance for jitter versus
  responsiveness:

  - Fitness or vehicle-tracking apps often prefer stronger filtering.
  - Survey or scientific apps may prefer capturing unmodified raw samples.

  **Profiles**

  | Policy | Description | Use Case |
  |--------|-------------|----------|
  | {@link LocationFilterPolicy.PassThrough} | **No filtering.** Every received sample is recorded, even if noisy or identical to the previous one. | Debugging, diagnostics, scenarios requiring raw data. |
  | {@link LocationFilterPolicy.Adjust} | **Balanced filtering.** Smooths and rejects only clearly invalid samples. *(Default)* | Most use cases — walking, cycling, automotive tracking. |
  | {@link LocationFilterPolicy.Conservative} | **Strict filtering.** Strongly smooths data and rejects high-variance samples, prioritizing stability over responsiveness. | Analytics, long-term background logging, noise-sensitive applications. |

  **Notes**

  - This policy affects only the SDK’s *internal* filtering pipeline.
    It does **not** modify the raw values returned to {@link BackgroundGeolocation.onLocation}.
  - For more granular tuning, see {@link LocationFilter.trackingAccuracyThreshold},
    {@link LocationFilter.maxImpliedSpeed}, and other {@link LocationFilter} fields.

  **Examples**

  Balanced default filtering:

  ```ts
  BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
    geolocation: {
      filter: {
        policy: LocationFilterPolicy.Adjust
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  No filtering — capture all raw locations:

  ```ts
  BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
    geolocation: {
      filter: {
        policy: LocationFilterPolicy.PassThrough
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  Maximum smoothing for analytics:

  ```ts
  BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
    geolocation: {
      filter: {
        policy: LocationFilterPolicy.Conservative
      }
    }
  });
  ```
