description: |-
  The age of the location in milliseconds, relative to the Device system-time when the location was received.
  For example, if the reported `age` is `10000`, that location was recorded 10s ago, relative to the system-time.
  `location.timestamp` + `location.age` = Device system-time when location was recorded.
