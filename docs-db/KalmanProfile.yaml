description: |-
  Specifies the preset tuning profile for the Kalman filter used in location
  denoising.

  Each profile adjusts the Kalman filter’s process and measurement noise
  parameters, trading off between responsiveness and smoothness:

  | Profile              | Behavior                                                            |
  |----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `defaultProfile`     | **Balanced** — General-purpose; suitable for most movement types.   |
  | `aggressive`         | **Aggressive** — Fast response; minimal smoothing.                   |
  | `conservative`       | **Conservative** — Maximum smoothing; slowest response to changes.  |

  - If no profile is provided, `defaultProfile` is applied.
  - Use `aggressive` for fast-changing activities requiring rapid updates.
  - Use `conservative` when stability and track smoothness are more important
    than immediate responsiveness.

  This maps directly to native Kalman tuning implementations on both Android and iOS.
