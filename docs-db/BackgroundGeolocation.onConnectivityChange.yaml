signature: 'onConnectivityChange(cb: (event: ConnectivityChangeEvent) => void): Subscription;'
description: |-
  Subscribe to changes in network connectivity.

  Fired when the state of the device's network-connectivity changes (enabled -> disabled and vice-versa).  By default, the plugin will automatically fire
  a `connectivitychange` event with the current state network-connectivity whenever the {@link start} method is executed.

  ℹ️ The SDK subscribes internally to `connectivitychange` events &mdash; if you've configured the SDK's HTTP Service (See {@link HttpEvent | HTTP Guide}) and your app has queued locations,
  the SDK will automatically initiate uploading to your configured {@link HttpConfig.url} when network connectivity is detected.
