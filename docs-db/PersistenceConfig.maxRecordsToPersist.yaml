signature: 'maxRecordsToPersist?: number;'
description: |-
  Maximum number of records the SDK may retain in its on-device SQLite
  database.

  A value of `-1` (default) means **no limit**. When a limit is set and the
  number of stored records would exceed this value, the oldest records are
  purged to make room for the newest.

  See {@link HttpEvent} for details on upload behavior.
