  Enable location + geofence tracking.

  This is the SDK's power **ON** button.  The plugin will initially start into its **stationary** state, fetching an initial location before
  turning off location services.  Android will be monitoring its **Activity Recognition System** while iOS will create a stationary geofence around
  the current location.

  __⚠️ Note:__
  If you've configured a {@link AppConfig.schedule}, this method will override that schedule and engage tracking immediately.
