signature: 'autoSyncThreshold?: number;'
description: |-
  The minimum number of persisted records the plugin must accumulate
  before triggering an automatic upload via {@link autoSync}.

  Defaults to **`0`** (no threshold).

  When set to a value greater than `0`, the SDK will wait until at least that
  many locations are recorded before uploading to your configured
  {@link url}.

  Using `autoSyncThreshold` together with {@link batchSync} can
  significantly **reduce battery consumption**, since batching minimizes the
  number of HTTP requests (which cost far more power than GPS work).


  __⚠️ Warning:__ Ignored during `onMotionChange`

  If you've configured `autoSyncThreshold`, it will be **ignored** during
  {@link BackgroundGeolocation.onMotionChange} transitions:

  - Entering the **moving** state:
    The device may have been dormant for a long time; the SDK eagerly uploads
    queued locations immediately.

  - Entering the **stationary** state:
    The device may *soon become* dormant; the SDK eagerly uploads all queued
    locations before going idle.
