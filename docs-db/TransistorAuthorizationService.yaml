  Transistor Software hosts a demo server at [tracker.transistorsoft.com](http://tracker.transistorsoft.com) which is
  designed to consume location data from devices running the Background Geolocation SDK.

  You may also run your own instance of Demo Server locally.  See [background-geolocation-console](https://github.com/transistorsoft/background-geolocation-console)

  The test server is a great way to debug location problems or evalute the SDK's behaviour, since the results can easily
  be shared with *Transistor Software* when requesting support.
