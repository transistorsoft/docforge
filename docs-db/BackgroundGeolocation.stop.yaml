  Disable location and geofence monitoring.  This is the SDK's power **OFF** button.

  @example example-1

  __⚠️ Note:__
  If you've configured a {@link AppConfig.schedule}, **`#stop`** will **not** halt the Scheduler.  You must explicitly {@link stopSchedule} as well:

  @example example-2
examples:
  example-1:
    title: Example 1
    code:
      ts: BackgroundGeolocation.stop();
  example-2:
    title: Example 2
    code:
      ts: |-
        // Later when you want to stop the Scheduler (eg: user logout)
        BackgroundGeolocation.stopSchedule();
