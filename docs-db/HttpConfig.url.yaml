  Server URL where you want the SDK to post recorded locations.

  Both the iOS and Android native code host their own robust HTTP service
  which can automatically upload recorded locations to your server. This is
  particularly important on **Android** when running headless with
  {@link AppConfig.stopOnTerminate} set to `false`, since only the plugin's
  background service continues running in that state.

  @example example-1

  __Warning:__ It is highly recommended to let the SDK manage uploads to your
  server, **especially on Android** when {@link AppConfig.stopOnTerminate} is
  `false`. In that mode your application component *will* terminate—only the
  native Android background service continues operating, recording locations
  and posting them to your server. The SDK’s HTTP service automatically
  retries on failures and is more reliable for background delivery than
  ad-hoc HTTP requests from your own code.

  See the HTTP guide under {@link HttpConfig} for full examples, error
  handling, and payload structure.

    code:
      ts: |-
        // Listen to HTTP events.
        BackgroundGeolocation.onHttp((event) => {
          console.log("[onHttp]", event);
        });

        BackgroundGeolocation.ready({
          http: {
            url: "https://my-server.com/locations",
            params: {
              user_id: 1234
            },
            headers: {
              Authorization: "Basic my-secret-key"
